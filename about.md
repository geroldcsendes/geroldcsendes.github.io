## Why blogging?
My name is Gerold and I do ML for a living. I created this blog to share the stuff I do or learn in ML. My journey in data science started 3 years ago but there is still a lot to learn for me. Lifelong learning is definitely a thing.
Though I did develop my own best practices and mental models that I apply on an everyday basis. My goal is to put them to paper and also to share insightful projects of others along with my comments. 

My targeted audience is mostly those starting out in this exciting field. In my opinion, being a beginner is always a challenging assignment. I personally mostly suck at things at first but with dedicated work I usually turn out to be just okay. The same applied to my career in data science. So, don't be discouraged just because learning data science seems like a daunting task. It is supposed to be that way. I believe that these folks can benefit from tutorials and other content that use an easy, non-techie lingo and clear instructions. I try to keep my posts just like that. 

## whoami
I have a BA in applied economics which is basically economics with lots of maths. Part of that is econometrics which deals mostly with causality analysis of economics. Econometrics shares a great deal of methodology with ML and taking the 101 course sparked my interest in ML. Luckily, shortly afterwards I landed my first data science job at [Hiflylabs](https://hiflylabs.hu/), a Budapest-based IT consultancy where I was part of the analytics team. I was lucky enough to take part in exciting projects like fraud and churn detection, solving optimization problems in retail and engineering and also employee segmentation. In the meantime, I did an awesome Master in [Business Analytics](https://courses.ceu.edu/programs/ms/master-science-business-analytics) at the Central European University. Right now I work as an ML Engineer at [epam](https://www.epam.com/) currently with the focus on developing smart city solutions on the West Coast of the US.
